Unity 6.1 better URP Tree Brush since Unity deleted the old one on new version :/ 

Just a Basic no License Tree Brush for everyone free to use / Edit - whatever you wanna do


Tutorial : 

Download the CS File. 
Open your Unity Project
Go to Assets and search for an Editor Folder ( If you dont have one Create one - Right Click - Create Folder - Editor )
Put the CS File in there. If you cant.. create one with Right Click - Script - C# and copy the code from cs file into the Script which you can do with notepad++ or anything alike
Let Unity reload / Compile - Top Bar go to Tools and select Tree Brush
Voila you got it open.
Now click on Terrain on the Plus add the Terrain you wanna use it on. Add your Prefab Trees and start Brushing you can change Density and Brush Size.

Keep CTRL Hold to Delete while Painting ( Brush gonna change color to red ) - there you go! Got a nice On/Off for Deleting / Placing Trees
